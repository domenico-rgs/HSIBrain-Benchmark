Evaluation of several deep learning models for brain tumor detection through the use of hyperspectral images from the [SLIM Brain Database](https://slimbrain.citsem.upm.es/) and the [Las Palmas HSI Human Brain Database](https://hsibraindatabase.iuma.ulpgc.es/).

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.10
- Pytorch 2.3.1 (+ all the packages in the `.yml` files)
- Cuda 12.4 for parallelization

## Directories and Files
* **job_scripts/** - Contains the .sh files used to launch the training jobs on our clusters.
* **models/** - Contains all the architectures evaluated in this study.
* **plots/** - Conda notebooks used to generate the figures with the results.
* **utils/** - Some useful scripts employed as well as the code for the Focal Loss and the LARC optimizer.
  
The main train/evaluation code is contained in the `main.py` and `engine.py` files. The `run_with_submitit.py` files allow to easily sbatch a job on a Slurm cluster. The json files are the lists of the images from both the dataset used in this work.
